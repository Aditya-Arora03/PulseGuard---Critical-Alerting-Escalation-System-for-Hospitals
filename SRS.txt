Project Name: PulseGuard: Critical Alerting & Escalation System for Hospitals
Prepared by: \[Your Name] (Solo Manual Tester)
Document Version: v1.0
Date: 05-Aug-2025

 1. Introduction

 1.1 Purpose

PulseGuard is a critical alerting and escalation system designed for hospitals to manage patient-related alerts in real-time. The goal is to reduce response times, ensure alert acknowledgment, enable automatic escalations, and maintain compliance with service-level agreements (SLAs). This document defines all requirements and modules for building robust test cases.

---

 2. Scope

PulseGuard will:

* Receive real-time alerts from patient monitoring systems.
* Display alerts in a user-friendly dashboard.
* Support filtering, sorting, and search.
* Escalate unacknowledged alerts based on time thresholds.
* Notify users via SMS, email, or push.
* Allow acknowledgment and comments from staff.
* Provide audit logs, reporting, and admin configuration options.
* Work smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

 3. Modules Overview

The system is divided into 8 major modules:

| Module No. | Name                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| 1          | Alert Monitoring UI       |
| 2          | Escalation Workflow       |
| 3          | Acknowledgment & Comments |
| 4          | Admin Configurations      |
| 5          | Notification System       |
| 6          | Reports & Audit Logs      |
| 7          | Security & Access Control |
| 8          | Dashboard Responsiveness  |

 ðŸ”· 1. Alert Monitoring UI

Description:
Central dashboard where alerts are displayed in real-time with filtering, searching, and severity highlighting.

Functional Requirements:

* Real-time alerts from patient monitoring systems.
* Visual differentiation based on severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
* Auto-refresh of alert list.
* Filter by:

  * Date/time
  * Department
  * Alert type
  * Severity
* Mark alert status: unresolved, acknowledged.
* Search by:

  * Patient ID
  * Room number
  * Alert ID
* Sort alerts by:

  * Time
  * Severity
  * Escalation status
* View alert details (patient info, room, timestamp).
* Mobile responsive layout.

 ðŸ”· 2. Escalation Workflow

Description:
Automated escalation process for alerts not acknowledged in time.

Functional Requirements:

* Auto-escalation based on configurable time thresholds.
* Multi-level escalation logic (Nurse â†’ Doctor â†’ Admin).
* Rules per alert type and department.
* If user fails to respond, notify next in hierarchy.
* Display full escalation path history per alert.
* Admin can manually override escalation.
* Re-triggering alerts if still inactive.
* SLA violation marker.

 ðŸ”· 3. Acknowledgment & Comments

Description:
Allows healthcare staff to acknowledge alerts and add comments.

Functional Requirements:

* Acknowledge alerts manually.
* Add free-text comments on alerts.
* View acknowledgment history.
* Prevent duplicate acknowledgment.
* Mark alerts as resolved post-action.

---

 ðŸ”· 4. Admin Configurations

Description:
Admin can customize rules, departments, alert types, escalation paths.

Functional Requirements:

* Define departments and user roles.
* Configure escalation rules (timers, levels).
* Define alert types and severity mapping.
* Set user permissions and access levels.
* Maintain audit logs for every config change.

---

 ðŸ”· 5. Notification System

Description:
Responsible for alert delivery via multiple channels.

Functional Requirements:

* Send SMS/Email/Push notifications.
* Configurable templates by admin.
